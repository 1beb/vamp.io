title: Vamp Sava tutorials
---

We’ve created a set of showcase applications, services and corresponding blueprints that demonstrate Vamp’s core features - together we call them “Sava”. You can work with Sava in the [Vamp hello world](/try-vamp/hello-world/) setup (or one of our other quick setups).

Sava is a mythical vampire from Serbia ([wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sava_Savanovi%C4%87)), but in our case it is a [Github repo](https://github.com/magneticio/sava) full of examples to help us demonstrate Vamp.

> **Note** Make sure you have a running version of Vamp. The quickest way to do this is by following the steps in [Vamp hello world](/try-vamp/hello-world/)

Once you have Vamp up and running you can work through the Sava tutorials:

1. [Deploy your first blueprint](deploy-your-first-blueprint/)
2. [Run a canary release](run-a-canary-release/)
3. [Split a monolith into services](split-into-services/)
4. [Merge a changed topology](merge-a-changed-topology/)
