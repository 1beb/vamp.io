## Vamp quick setup and tutorials
We've made it really easy to try out Vampâ€™s core features.

1. Get Vamp up and running in 3 steps with the [hello world](/try-vamp/hello-world/) quick setup  
_You could also follow one of our [other quick setups](/resources/run-vamp/quick-setup/), but we recommend hello world as it's the most straightforward._
2. Work through the Sava tutorials:
  * [Deploy your first blueprint](/try-vamp/sava-tutorials/deploy-your-first-blueprint/)
  * [Run a canary release](/try-vamp/sava-tutorials/run-a-canary-release/)
  * [Split a monolith into services](/try-vamp/sava-tutorials/split-into-services/)
  * [Merge a changed topology](/try-vamp/sava-tutorials/merge-a-changed-topology/)


## Get started with Vamp on your architecture
When you're ready to [run Vamp on your architecture](/resources/run-vamp/), we have full instructions for working with Vamp binaries and configuring the required components. If you need help you can find us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/magneticio/vamp)
