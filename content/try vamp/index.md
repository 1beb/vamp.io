title: try Vamp
---

We’ve created a set of showcase applications, services and corresponding blueprints that demonstrate Vamp’s core features - together we call them “Sava”. You can work with Sava in the Vamp hello world setup (or using one of our other quick setups). 

To get to grips with how Vamp works, we advise that you: 

1. Get Vamp up and running with [hello world](/try-vamp/hello-world/) quick setup
2. work through the [Sava tutorials](/try-vamp/sava-tutorials/)

> **Note:** If you need help you can find us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/magneticio/vamp)  

## Hello world
The easiest way to get Vamp started is to follow the [hello world](hello-world/) quick setup. This will run Vamp inside a local Docker container with Vamp’s Marathon driver.   

_You could also follow one of our [other quick setups](/resources/run-vamp/quick-setup/), but we recommend hello world as it's the most straightforward._

Once you have Vamp up and running you can work through the Sava tutorials.  

## Sava tutorials

Sava is a mythical vampire from Serbia ([wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sava_Savanovi%C4%87)), but in our case it is a [Github repo](https://github.com/magneticio/sava) full of examples to help us demonstrate Vamp.

> **Note:** Make sure you have a running version of Vamp. The easiest way to do this is by following the Vamp [hello world](hello-world/) quick setup

Once you have Vamp up and running, you can work through the Sava tutorials:

1. [Deploy your first blueprint](sava-tutorials/deploy-your-first-blueprint/)
2. [Run a canary release](sava-tutorials/run-a-canary-release/)
3. [Split a monolith into services](sava-tutorials/split-into-services/)
4. [Merge a changed topology](sava-tutorials/merge-a-changed-topology/)
