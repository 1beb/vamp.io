title: Why use Vamp?
---

We recognise the pain and risk involved with delivering microservice applications.  We've been there too - facing downtime and unexpected issues while transitioning from one release to the next. 
In microservice architectures, these concerns can quickly multiply. It's all too easy to get stuck dealing with the added complexities and miss out on the potential benefits. 

## Deploy online services, seamlessly

Vamp is an open source, self-hosted platform for managing (micro)service oriented architectures that rely on container technology. The Vamp DSL allows you to describe your services, their dependencies and required runtime environments in blueprints.  These blueprints can then be deployed by the Vamp runtime/execution engine (similar to AWS Cloudformation). You can monitor and manage deployments and running services from your choice of interface - graphical UI, command line or RESTful API. Vamp workflows can also monitor applications for you and act automatically based on pre-defined SLAs.

With Vamp you can orchestrate complex deployment patterns, such as architecture level A/B testing and canary releases, from one intuitive (graphical) interface. Vamp takes care of all the heavy lifting - route updates, metrics collection and service discovery.
