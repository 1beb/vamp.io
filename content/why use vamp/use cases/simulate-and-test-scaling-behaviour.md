title: Simulate and test scaling behaviour
---

_"How would our system react if... the number of users increased x10 ... the latency of a new service dropped by 20 seconds ... an entire tier of our application would be killed ..."_  
Your company might dream of overnight success, but what if it actually happened? Stress tests rarely cater to extreme circumstances, and are often done on systems that are not identical to production environments. Oftentimes the bottleneck sits in the system simulating the load itself, so it's difficult to predict what would actually happen or to know if your planned responses will really help.

Why not find out for sure? Using Vamp you can test your services and applications against seemingly impossible situations, and then validate and optimise the scripted responses. With the same workflows as would be running in production, on the same infrastructure, with the same settings.

1. __Mock required load:__ Vamp can simulate (mock) high-stress situations for any kind of metric your system needs to respond to, without actually having to generate real traffic.
2. __Optimise:__ You can optimise your resource allocation and autoscaling configurations based on real validated behaviour under stress.
3. __Iterate until you're certain:__ Vamp can repeat the tests until you're confident with the outcome. Then you can use the same scaling and optimising workflows in production.
