title: use cases
---

The integrated [deployment](/documentation/tutorials/deploy-your-first-blueprint/), [routing](/documentation/tutorials/run-a-canary-release/) and [workflow](/documentation/using-vamp/workflows/) features of Vamp support a broad range of scenarios and industry verticals. We specifically see powerful use-cases in the areas of testing in production, migrating to microservices, and realtime system optimisation. In this section we describe specific scenarios and how Vamp can effectively solve these.

NB Of course we're very interested in hearing your specific use-cases, if you have an interesting one please send us an email at info@magnetic.io.
