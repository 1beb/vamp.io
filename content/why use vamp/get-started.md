## Try Vamp
Weâ€™ve created some quick setups, demo applications and tutorials so you can [try Vamp out for yourself](/try-vamp/).

## Vamp components

Before you get Vamp up and running on your architecture, it is helpful to understand [how vamp works](/resources/how-vamp-works/) and the role of each component in [typical architectures](/resources/how-vamp-works/example-architectures/).

## Run Vamp

Set Vamp up to run on your architecture in a [production-grade custom set up](/resources/run-vamp/).
