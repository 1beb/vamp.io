title: Proxies and load balancers

## Vamp compared to software based proxies and load balancers
_HAproxy, NGINX, linkerd, Traefik_   
Vamp adds programmable routing (percentage and condition based) and load balancing to the battle-tested HAProxy proxy, as well as a REST API, graphical UI and CLI.  This means you can use Vamp together with all common container-schedulers to provide continuous delivery and auto-scaling features using automatic load balancing and clustering of scaled out container instances. By default Vamp is packaged with HAProxy, but you could also integrate the Vamp magic with other programmable proxies such as NGINX, linkerd or Traefik.
