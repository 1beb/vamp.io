### How Vamp works
This will change as I work through the content - it will cover the concept details that don't give specific instructions. This section could sit under "what is Vamp", but is more technically focussed and "what is Vamp" is already quite full with the more business-focussed content.   
We could make this content the "what is Vamp" section and use the business focussed there as a "how do I sell this to my boss"
