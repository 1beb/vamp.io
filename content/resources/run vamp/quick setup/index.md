title: Quick setup
---

To help you try out Vamp, we've put together a collection of quick setup walkthroughs. These are a great way to get to grips with the power of Vamp and work through the [Vamp Sava tutorials](/try-vamp/sava-tutorials).

>**Note:** Quick setups are not production grade setups!

* **[Hello world](/try-vamp/hello-world/)** - our easiest quick setup, runs Vamp together with Mesos and Marathon ([mesosphere.github.io - Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/)) inside a local Docker container
* **[DC/OS quick setup](/resources/run-vamp/quick-setup/quick-setup-dcos/)**
* **[Kubernetes quick setup](/resources/run-vamp/quick-setup/quick-setup-kubernetes/)** - Kubernetes support is still in Alpha
* **[Rancher quick setup](/resources/run-vamp/quick-setup/quick-setup-rancher/)** - Rancher support is still in Alpha

If you're looking for a more in-depth guide to getting Vamp up and running in a production grade setup on your architecture, see [Vamp on your architecture](/resources/run-vamp#run-vamp-on-your-architecture)
