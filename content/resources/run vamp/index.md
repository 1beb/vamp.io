## Quick demo setup

>**Note:** Quick setups are not production grade setups!

To let you try out Vamp, we've put together a collection of quick setup walkthroughs.   

* [Vamp quick setup](/resources/run-vamp/quick-setup/)

These are a great way to get to grips with the power of Vamp and work through the [Vamp Sava tutorials](/try-vamp/sava-tutorials).

## Run Vamp on your architecture

Before you get Vamp up and running on your architecture, it is helpful to understand [how vamp works](/resources/how-vamp-works/) and the role of each component and its preferred location in [typical architectures](/resources/how-vamp-works/example-architectures/).
