## Quick demo setup

To help you try out Vamp, we've put together a collection of quick setup walkthroughs. These are a great way to get to grips with the power of Vamp and work through the [Vamp Sava tutorials](/try-vamp/#vamp-sava-tutorials).

>**Note:** Quick setups are not production grade setups!

* [Hello world](/vamp-hello-world/) - our easiest quick setup, runs Vamp together with Mesos and [Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/) inside a local Docker container
* [Quick setup with DC/OS](/quick-setup-dcos/)
* [Quick setup with Kubernetes](/quick-setup-kubernetes/) - Kubernetes support is still in Alpha
* [Quick setup with Rancher](/quick-setup-rancher/) - Rancher support is still in Alpha
