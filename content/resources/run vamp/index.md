## Run Vamp on your architecture

Before you get Vamp up and running on your architecture, it is helpful to understand [how vamp works](/resources/how-vamp-works/) and the role of each component and its preferred location in [typical architectures](/resources/how-vamp-works/example-architectures/).  

If you need help you can find us on [Gitter] (https://gitter.im/magneticio/vamp)

## Quick demo setup

We've put together a collection of [quick setup walkthroughs](/resources/run-vamp/quick-setup/) to let you try out some of Vamp's core features. You can use these to work through the [Vamp Sava tutorials](/try-vamp/sava-tutorials).
