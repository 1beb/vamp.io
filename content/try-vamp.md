title: try Vamp
---

To show off some of Vamp’s core features, we’ve created a set of showcase applications, services and corresponding blueprints, together we call them “Sava”. 

## Hello world
First off you will need a running version of Vamp. The quickest way to get Vamp started is to follow the steps in [Vamp hello world](/vamp-hello-world/). This will run Vamp inside a local Docker container with Vamp’s Marathon driver.   

> **Note** If you need help you can find us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/magneticio/vamp)  

* [Vamp hello world](/vamp-hello-world/)

You could also follow [one of our other quick setups](/install/), but Hello world is the most straightforward.

Once you have Vamp up and running you can work through the Sava tutorials.  


## Vamp Sava tutorials

Sava is a mythical vampire from Serbia ([wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sava_Savanovi%C4%87)), but in our case it is a [Github repo](https://github.com/magneticio/sava) full of examples to help us demonstrate Vamp.

> **Note** Make sure you have Vamp installed. The quickest way to do this is by following the steps in [Vamp hello world](/vamp-hello-world/)

Once you have Vamp up and running you can work through the Sava tutorials:

1. [deploy your first blueprint](/deploy-your-first-blueprint/)
2. [run a canary release](/run-a-canary-release/)
3. [split a monolith into services](/split-into-services/)
4. [merge a changed topology](/merge/)
