# Deploying your first blueprint

If everything went to plan, you should have your Vamp installation up & running. If not, please check [how to install
Vamp](/getting-started/)

To quickly show of some of Vamp's core features, we've created a set of showcase applications, services and corresponding blueprints, together called Sava. Sava is a mythical vampire from Serbia ([wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sava_Savanovi%C4%87)) but in our case it is a [Github repo](https://github.com/magneticio/sava) full of examples to help us demonstrate Vamp.
