In an earlier tutorial we showed how Vamp workflows can be used to automate all kinds of useful behaviour, for example to automate canary releasing with rollbacks, or autoscaling. In this tutorial, we will explain in more detail how the Vamp workflow system works and create a workflow that accesses the Vamp events system. We will first create and retrieve some custom events manually using the Vamp REST API, then create a simple workflow to automate these actions. Let's get started!

### Requirements

* A running version of Vamp 0.9.x (this tutorial has been tested on the [Vamp hello world set up](documentation/installation/hello-world) using Vamp 0.9.2)

## The Vamp events system
Vamp is a distributed system tied together by a central events stream. Every action in Vamp creates events, which in turn can be used as triggers for new actions. For example, gateway updates are triggered by deployments (synchronisation events), while canary releases and autoscaling actions are based on calculated health and metrics events.  Vamp events are described in the format:  

`['tag', 'tag1:tag2'], value, event_type` 

### Event types
Vamp works with a number of default event types, custom event types can also be created using the `events` API endpoint (more on that later). If no event type is specified when creating an event, the generic event type `event` will be used. It is advisable to always specify an event type to allow for easy filtering.

Default event types |  Description
----------|--------
Archive     |    Store/update of static Vamp artifacts (breeds, blueprints etc.)
Synchronisation | Successful matching of a desired state with an observed state (for example, a successful update from 3 to 5 running instances)
Event | Generic event type, will be used if no event type is specified when creating an event
Health | Generated by the health workflow and used by the Vamp UI
Metrics | Generated by the metrics workflow and used by the Vamp UI
Workflow | Generated by workflows used in Vamp Runner

### Event tags
Each event created by Vamp is given one or more tags. Tags provide meta-information for each stored event and are used for filtering search and for listening. Tags can be either a single tag or a combination of two tags separated by a `:`. The Vamp convention is to use the first tag as a generic label (for example a group) and the second tag as a specific label (i.e. a specific item in a group). `generic_tag:specific_tag`

### Event value
The event value is optional and could be anything you choose to store along with an event. Values are not analysed and can't be used for search. If you don’t specify value, it will be blank


### Storing events
Vamp events are stored by default in Elasticsearch using the integrated Vamp Pulse module. Elasticsearch indexing is based on the event type and is updated for each event received by the API. Each event type will be indexed individually, including custom event types  .  
[Read more about events](documentation/using-vamp/events/)

  
## Create events with the REST API

The `events` endpoint of the Vamp API can be used to create and retrieve events. We are going to use this endpoint to create an event with the custom type `hello_api`. Note that custom event type names may only include alphanumerics, ‘_’ and ‘-’.

Use Postman or curl to `POST` the below JSON to the `/api/v1/events` endpoint.

```
{
  "tags": [
    "tag1:tag2"
  ],
  "value": "optional_value",
  "type": "hello_api"
}
```  
If all runs to plan, you will receive a response from the API with the accepted JSON in the body. You will notice that a timestamp has been added. In Elasticsearch the event tag will be expanded, so you will be able to search on for this event with both the separate generic tag `tag1` and the combined generic:specific tag `tag1:tag2`. If you check in the Vamp UI, you will see the created event show up in the EVENTS stream at the bottom of the screen (of course you need to open the events stream panel first :).

## Create a simple event workflow
Now we know how to create and read events with the Vamp API, we can take this a step further and create a simple workflow to automate the process. You could also use Vamp workflows to aggregate and calculate metrics and send these out as events again, like the default “metrics” and “health” workflows and events that are used by the Vamp UI to create graphs. 

### A bit about workflows

Vamp workflows are a convenient way of creating Node JS based scripts that run as containers and access the Vamp API. JavaScript workflows run in Vamp workflow agent containers ([github.com/magneticio - Vamp workflow agent](https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-workflow-agent)) and are managed just like any other container inside your cluster, making them robust, scalable and dynamic. You can schedule workflows to run as a daemon, be triggered by Vamp events or to run at specified times (a compatible Vamp workflow driver is required for time and event based scheduling). You could also create your own workflows using your language of preference - create an application or script that accesses the Vamp API and build it into a docker container that can be deployed by Vamp.

We are going to create a workflow that runs as a daemon (i.e. all the time). We'll start by creating a breed with the required workflow-script and then deploy this as a Vamp workflow. It is advisable to create a Vamp breed artifact containing the workflow script and then reference the breed from a workflow definition - once a workflow is stopped it will be deleted, whereas a breed can be referenced and re-deployed any number of times.

### Create a breed 
The breed will hold the JavaScript to be run for our workflow. To be able to interact with Vamp, we will need to include a few items in the JavaScript. The Vamp Node.js Client library allows the Node.js application to easily interact with the Vamp API, see the gitHub project for more details ([github.com/magneticio - Vamp Node.js Client](https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-node-client)). In the script we will create a new Vamp API object and set a run interval.


  1. Go the BREEDS tab in the Vamp UI
  * Click ADD
  * Paste in the below breed YAML and click SAVE

```
name: hello_workflow
deployable:
  type: application/javascript
  definition: |
    'use strict';

    var vamp = require('vamp-node-client'); // required to interact with the Vamp API

    var api = new vamp.Api(); // a new Vamp API object

    // create a Vamp event - tag, value, event_type
    api.event('tag1:tag2', 'optional_value', 'hello_workflow');   
  
```
![](images/screens/v091/events_vampui_breeds.png)

### Deploy the hello_workflow breed as a workflow
After successfully saving the `hello_workflow` breed, we can create a workflow that references it. Once the workflow is created, the script from the breed will be deployed inside a Vamp workflow agent container. We will schedule our workflow to run as a daemon, so it will immediately start running at the set interval (5 seconds).

1. Go to the WORKFLOWS tab in the Vamp UI 
* Click ADD (top right)
* Paste in the below workflow YAML and click SAVE

```
name: hello_workflow
breed: hello_workflow
environment_variables:
  VAMP_WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_PERIOD: '5' 
  VAMP_WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT: '4'  # should be less than VAMP_WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_PERIOD
schedule: daemon
```
The workflow will be deployed and you will see the created events appearing in the Vamp UI EVENTS stream.

### Update the running workflow
Updates made to a breed will not be carried over to an associated workflow directly. Vamp breeds are static artifacts, so updating the breed alone has no effect on a running workflow. To update a running workflow, it must be restarted. Let's update our running workflow so it runs every second.
 
1. Go the WORKFLOWS tab in the Vamp UI
* Open the `hello_workflow` workflow and update the VAMP_WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_PERIOD to 1 (this will cause the events to be generated every second)
* Click SAVE
* Check the events stream in the Vamp UI 
  * `hello_workflow` events will continue to appear every 5 seconds
* Click RESTART on the `hello_workflow` workflow 
  * The workflow will be stopped and restarted, applying the changes we made. 
* Check the events stream again 
  * `hello_workflow` will now be generating events every second - that's a lot of events! Feel free to click SUSPEND to temporarily stop the workflow running or delete it completely.

## Retrieve and filter events using the REST API
Now we have a lot of events stored we can use the same REST API events endpoint to retrieve them. We can search for specific events and filter for specific types and tags. You can try this out in Postman or curl by sending a GET request to the `/api/v1/events` endpoint, you can even do this in your browser. Search through stored events using `?type=` or `?tags=` (following the tag format `generic` or `generic:specifc`). Note that it is not possible to filter for specific values.  
See [using the Vamp API](/documentation/api/using-the-api) for details on pagination.

The API can also be used to retrieve an events stream `/api/v1/events/stream`

## Summing up
You should now know a bit more about the Vamp events system and how it is used by the distributed components of Vamp like, for example, workflows. Now you understand how to build, deploy and update your own workflows there should be no stopping you - what will you automate?

## Looking for more of a challenge?
Just for fun, you could try these:

* Can you create a workflow that responds to a specific Vamp event?
* The Vamp Node.js Client library also allows you to create workflows that measure and count metrics. How might you incorporate that functionality into an automation workflow? See the gitHub project for details ([github.com/magneticio - Vamp Node.js Client](https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-node-client)) or check the examples used in the Vamp runner recipes ([github.com/magneticio - Vamp Runner recipes](https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-runner/tree/master/recipes))
