Vamp combines static artifacts - blueprints, breeds, conditions and scales - to initiate deployments. Once initiated, a deployment is always moving forwards. You can manage the deployment by adding elements to it (merging) or taking elements away from it (deleting). Merge and delete operations can be initiated manually (via the Vamp API or Vamp UI) or automatically by active workflows.  

In this tutorial we will look at how to manage a running deployment adding and removing elements, tracking manual and automated updates through the Vamp events stream and ultimately deleting all elements to fully undeploy.
