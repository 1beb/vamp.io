# Getting started tutorial

To quickly learn Vamp's core features, we've created a set of showcase applications, services and corresponding blueprints, together called "Sava". 

Sava is a mythical vampire from Serbia ([wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sava_Savanovi%C4%87)) but in our case it is a [Github repo](https://github.com/magneticio/sava) full of examples to help us demonstrate Vamp.

Make sure you first have Vamp installed. The quickest way to do this is to check out the [quick start](/quick-start/)

Please follow the tutorial in the following steps to get a good understanding of Vamp's core features:

[1. Deploying your first blueprint](/documentation/guides/getting-started-tutorial/1-deploying/)

[2. Doing a canary release](/documentation/guides/getting-started-tutorial/2-canary-release/)

[3. Splitting into multiple services](/documentation/guides/getting-started-tutorial/3-splitting-services/)

[4. Merging and deleting services](/documentation/guides/getting-started-tutorial/4-merge-delete/)

[5. Autoscaling using Vamp SLA's and escalations] (/documentation/guides/getting-started-tutorial/5-sla-escalations/)
