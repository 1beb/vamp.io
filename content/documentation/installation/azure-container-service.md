title: Azure Container Service
---

As Vamp works nicely with DC/OS, and [Azure Container Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-service/) gives you the choice to select DC/OS as it's default Docker container scheduler, Vamp also works with Azure Container Service.

After you activated your ACS setup with DC/OS, go to your DC/OS admin environment, and then use our [DC/OS installation instructions](/documentation/installation/dcos/) to install Vamp.
