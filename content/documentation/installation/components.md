# Understanding Vamp's components

To get Vamp up and running on an architecture of your choice, you first need to have a basic grip on Vamp's various components and how Vamp works with [container drivers](/documentation/installation/container_drivers/).

## Architecture and components

Vamp consists of multiple server and client side components that together create the Vamp platform. Before installing, it is very helpful to understand the role of each component and its preferred location in a typical architecture.

>**Note**: This diagram should be used more as an overview than required architecture. Here we also include [Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/)/[Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/) stack even though it is not a hard dependency.

### [Vamp](https://github.com/magneticio/vamp)

Main API endpoint, business logic and service coordinator. 
Talks to the configured container manager (Docker, Marathon etc.) and synchronizes it with Vamp Gateway Agent via [ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/), [etcd](https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/) or [Consul](https://www.consul.io/). 
Uses Elasticsearch for artifact persistence and to store Vamp events (e.g. changes in deployments).

### [Vamp Gateway Agent](https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-gateway-agent)

Reads the HAProxy configuration from ZooKeeper, etcd or Consul and reloads the HAProxy on each configuration change with as close to zero client request interruptions as possible. 
Reads the logs from HAProxy over socket and pushes them to Logstash (not presented on the diagram above) over UDP. Handles and recovers from ZooKeeper, etcd, Consul and Logstash outages without interrupting the HAProxy process and client requests.

>**Note**: **Vamp Gateway Agent (VGA)** requires HAProxy and at the moment HAProxy configuration is fully generated by Vamp. That means VGA requires dedicated HAProxy installation. Later we plan to support combining custom (non-Vamp) configuration as well.

More detailed information about building VGA from source and configuration can be found on the [project](https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-gateway-agent) page.

### [Vamp UI](https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-ui)

Graphical web interface for managing Vamp in a web browser. Packaged with Vamp. 

### Vamp CLI

Command line interface for managing Vamp and providing integration with (shell) scripts.
