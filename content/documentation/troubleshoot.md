The pointers below will help debug and resolve common issuesin case Vamp is not running as expected.

## What is the problem?

The most common problems we encounter are:

| Problem         | Description           | Probable cause    
| ----------------- |:-----------------:|:----------------:| 
| [Metrics not displaying](/documentation/troubleshoot/#metrics-not-displaying) |   For example, in the Vamp UI, health is reporting 0%   |  Workflows not running,  Logstash configuration issues
| [General strange behaviour](/documentation/troubleshoot/#general-strange-behaviour) |      |  System cleanup required
| [It just doesn't work](/documentation/troubleshoot/#it-just-doesn-t-work) |      |  incorrect version installed 

### Metrics not displaying
The Vamp UI reads events generated by the health and metrics workflows from the Elasticsearch indexes _health_ and _metrics_. To successfully generate these events, the health and metrics workflows need access to HAProxy logs, which are collected and stored in Elasticsearch by Vamp Gateway Agent (VGA) and Logstash.

If metrics are not displaying as expected, you should check that the health and metrics workflows are running, and that all the Elasticsearch indexes are being created.

- Are the metrics and health workflows running?  
  restart them

- Are the elasticsearch indexes being created?  
  HAProxy logs - check the logstash configuration  
  check the elasticsearch installation and configuration  
  what if I'm not using elasticsearch??

### General strange behaviour

- stop everything,  cleanup and restart

### It just doesn't work

- which version are you running?
- is everything running (check info in API or UI)?
- Are there errors in the Vamp log?

The required workflows are installed by default with our [hello world quick start](/documentation/installation/hello-world/) and the Vamp Docker images ([DC/OS](/documentation/installation/dcos/), [Kubernetes](/documentation/installation/kubernetes/) or [Rancher](/documentation/installation/rancher/)).
