* __Disruption free transition from one version to the next__  
  _Introduce service updates with control and clarity._  
  Vamp adds a layer of flexibility to conventional deployment strategies, enabling rolling upgrades by percentage. With multiple versions deployed you can instantly rollback with minimal visability to users.

* __Continous improvement empowered by real business data__  
  _Get updates into the hands of specified users, fast and optimise based on live data before rolling out to all users_  
  Vamp includes a versatile condition system to control which version of a service defined user cohorts are routed to. Metrics are agregated, so you can analyse usage and results to plan required enhancements. 

* __Zero downtime__  
  _Automatically track spikes and troughs in activity_   
  Vamp monitors individual services in your architecture and adapts resource allocation on a granular level.


## Your choice of platform
Vamp can link with common technologies or work standalone. With no platform lock-in, you are free to build an infrastructure that will adapt to fit your growing business.

* Mesos/Marathon
* Kubernetes
* [DC/OS](/docs/dcos/)
* Rancher
