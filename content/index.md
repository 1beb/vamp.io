Stop unnecessary downtime when releasing microservice and container based applications.  
Vamp removes the guesswork from planning and rolling out critical service upgrades.

* __Disruption free transition from one version to the next__  
_Introduce service updates with control and clarity._
* __Learn from your users__  
_Get updates into the hands of specified users, fast. Optimise services based on actual results, then increase traffic when you are satisfied._
* __Be online, be efficient__  
_Automatically track spikes and troughs in activity to ensure running services are given exactly the resources they need._
* __Fit with your choice of infrastructure__   
_Vamp links with common technologies (such as Docker, DC/OS, Mesos/Marathon) or can work standalone._

## Vamp - the canary test and release platform

Traditional release processes cause stress and risk that can negatively impact customer experience and stifle productivity.
_Vamp offers practical tools and metrics that_ 
 _[something about making already available technologies accessible in a useable “box”, offering advantages/removing disadvantages]_

* __Multiple versions__ By enabling multiple versions of a service to run side by side in production, Vamp adds a layer of flexibility to conventional blue/green releasing. 
* __Rolling upgrades by %__ Forget the on/off release command. Vamp introduces service upgrades gradually, to defined groups of users. You gain the space to measure, optimise and react.
* __Condition system__ Vamp's versatile condition system lets you control which version of your service defined users are routed to.
* __Granular allocation of resources__ Specify the resource requirements of individual services in your architecture and Vamp will automatically monitor and adapt.
