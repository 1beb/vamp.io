{{< /note >}}

* __API reference__
* __CLI reference__
* __Release notes__ - link to correct release notes in blog
* __Use Vamp__ - current content and its intended use needs to be reconsidered. Reference documentation needs to be clear and searchable, everything else should tell a story, answer a question and lead somewhere
* __Get started with Vamp__ - when linking to older versions, advise to get started with the current version
