title: try Vamp
---

To show of some of Vamp’s core features, we’ve created a set of showcase applications, services and corresponding blueprints, together called “Sava”. 

## Hello world
First of all you will need a running version of Vamp. The easiest way to install Vamp is to follow the [Vamp hello world with Marathon](/quick-setup/) instructions. This will run Vamp inside a local Docker container with Vamp’s Marathon driver - all on your local machine.  

> **Note** If you need help you can find us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/magneticio/vamp)

* [Vamp hello world with Marathon](/hello-world-marathon/)

## Vamp Sava tutorials

Once you have Vamp up and running you can follow the Sava tutorials.  
Sava is a mythical vampire from Serbia ([wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sava_Savanovi%C4%87)), but in our case it is a [Github repo](https://github.com/magneticio/sava) full of examples to help us demonstrate Vamp.

> **Note** Make sure you have Vamp installed. The quickest way to do this is by following the steps on [Vamp hello world with Marathon](/hello-world-marathon/)

1. [deploy your first blueprint](/deploy/)
2. [run a canary release](/canary-release/)
3. [split a monolith into services](/split-into-services/)
4. [merge a changed topology](/merge/)
