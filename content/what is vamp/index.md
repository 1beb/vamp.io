title: what is Vamp?
---

Vamp is an open source, self-hosted platform for managing (micro)service oriented architectures that rely on container technology. Vamp takes care of complex, multi-step actions like canary releases, route updates, metrics collection and service discovery.

## Deploy online services, seamlessly

Vamp gives you complete control over services, routing, runtime environments and planned deployments. All from your choice of interface - graphical UI, command line interface or RESTful API.

Vamp provides a model to describe (micro)services and their dependencies in blueprints, and a runtime/execution engine to deploy these blueprints, similar to AWS Cloudformation.
Vamp can orchestrate complex deployment patterns, such as architecture level A/B testing and canary releasing. Clear SLA management and service level enforcement are also included out of the box, enabling granular auto-scaling for each individual service.  

More about Vamp:

* Vamp is platform agnostic
* Vamp is functionality agnostic, but functions well in an API centric, event driven and stateless environment. 
* Vamp is not a strict container platform, but uses the power of container platforms under the hood.
* Vamp is written in Scala, Go and ReactJS

## More reward, less risk

Vamp manages deployments and running systems to bring you more of the benefits and less of the pain associated with complex microservice architectures.

### Microservice benefits and risks

#### Benefits

* (/) Faster development and deployment
* (/) Clear separation of concerns
* (/) Scalability and resiliency

#### Risks

* (x) Increased dependencies, each of which will inevitably fail at some point
* (x) Deployments and upgrades need coordination and orchestration
* (x) Security concerns multiply
* (x) Data feeds and monitoring/logs need to be aggregated and zipped together
