## Try Vamp
The best way to get to grips with Vamp is to try out our [hello world](/try-vamp/hello-world) (or another quick demo setup) and work through the Sava tutorials.  

## Vamp components

Before you get Vamp up and running on your architecture, it is helpful to understand [how vamp works](/resources/what-is-vamp/) and the role of each component in [typical architectures](/resources/how-vamp-works/example-architectures/).

## Run Vamp

Set Vamp up to run on your architecture in a production-grade custom set up.
