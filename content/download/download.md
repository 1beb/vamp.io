# Download Vamp

If you want to get started quickly, then **you don't need to install and run all components separately**, just head over to the [getting started](http://vamp.io/getting-started) 
page and run some pre-baked Docker images.

However, if you're brave and want to create a custom setup, please find all relevant Vamp downloads below.
