title: about us
---
Vamp is developed by Magnetic.io in the heart of Amsterdam.  
We’re dedicated to helping companies of all sizes increase efficiency, save time and reduce costs. We provide powerful and easy-to-use solutions to optimise systems.

## Vision
Time is precious.  
We believe people should focus their efforts on the things they excel at and that matter to them.  
Let computers do the repeatable and automatable tasks - they’re far more suited to that than us.

## Community
We encourage anyone to [join the Vamp community](/resources/community/) and pitch in with pull requests, bug reports etc. to make Vamp even more awesome.
