title: about us
---
Vamp is an open source project, actively developed by Magnetic.io.  
We’re dedicated to helping companies of all sizes increase efficiency, save time and reduce costs. We provide accessible and easy-to-use tools and solutions that optimise and automate complex systems. 


## Vision
Time is precious.  
We believe people should focus their efforts on the things they excel at and that matter to them.  
Let computers do the tasks - they’re far more suited to that than us.

## Community
We encourage anyone to [join the Vamp community](/resources/community/) and pitch in with pull requests, bug reports etc.
