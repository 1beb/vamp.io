Stop unnecessary downtime when releasing microservice and container based applications.  
Remove the guesswork from planning and rolling out critical service upgrades.

* __Disruption free transition from one version to the next__  
_Introduce service updates with control and clarity._  
Vamp adds a layer of flexibility to conventional deployment strategies, enabling rolling upgrades by percentage and instant rollback.

* __Zero downtime__  
_Track spikes and troughs in activity._  
Vamp monitors individual services in your architecture and adapts resource allocation automatically.
 
* __Data driven continous improvement__  
_Get updates into the hands of specified users, fast and optimise based on live data before rolling out to all users._  
Vamp includes a versatile condition system to control which version of your service a defined user cohort is routed to.  
   
* __No platform lock-in__  
_Fit with your choice of infrastructure_   
Vamp links with common technologies (such as Docker, DC/OS, Mesos/Marathon) or can work standalone.

## The freedom to fly

Traditional release strategies introduce unnecesary stress and risk that can stifle creativity.  
Vamp provides practical tools and metrics that reduce the uncertainty of deploying to production. You are free to focus on delivering products that match user needs.

something like the layered diagram on dcos.io, but focussing on a process rather than the technology. I can't draw it (yet). or a venn diagram.  
some kind of metaphor  
plan - develop - (test) - deploy - monitor_

### Canary releases

### Metrics aggregation

### Single pane of glass

## Deployments as code

Vamp gives you a platform agnostic DSL to describe microservices. Containerised service deployments become repeatable and scalable.

* service discovery (the Vamp way or your way)
