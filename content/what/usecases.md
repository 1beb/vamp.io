Vamp lets you tackle big projects with confidence:

* [Create a responsive website](#create-a-responsive-website)
* [Resolve incompatibilities after a major portal upgrade](#resolve-incompatibilities-after-a-major-portal-upgrade) 
* [Move legacy monolithic systems with VMs to microservices](#move-legacy-monolithic-systems-with-vms-to-microservices)
* [Modernise services, e.g. move to noSQL DB](#modernise-services-e-g-move-to-nosql-db) 

Running services are optimised to increase reliability:

## Create a responsive website
_“We need to upgrade the web frontend to make it responsive”_  
Developing a responsive web frontend traditionally requires a large investment of hours and extensive testing before you can go live (think of all the browser versions, screen sizes, resolutions...). Before you launch, it's hard to predict how your users will respond - will it actually convert?   

Vamp offers an alternative. Using canary release, the same project can be introduced to users with __minimal investment of hours__ and __increased certainty__.

1. __Start small:__ Build the new frontend for only one specific browser/resolution. Vamp can deploy the new frontend and route a percentage of supported users there (all other users will continue to see the old version of your website).
2. __Optimise:__ With your new service in the hands of real users, you can measure actual results and optimise accordingly.
3. __Scale up:__ Once you are satisified, you can use Vamp to develop and deploy one browser/resolution at a time. 


## Resolve incompatibilities after a major portal upgrade
_“We upgraded the portal, our biggest client is running an unsupported browser”_

resolve compatibility issues for specific users/clients. Remove the stress, take the necesary time to resolve

## Move legacy monolithic systems with VMs to microservices
work step by step

## Modernise services, e.g. move to noSQL DB  
A/B test architecture before you jump

## What would happen if…
predict response to peak time

## When…
Vamp can react to spiky traffic/load and take action on a granular level
