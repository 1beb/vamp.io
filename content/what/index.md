__Close the feedback loop, enable continuous improvement__
 
DevOps implementations often focus on continuous integration, release planning and continous delivery. This will improve time to market, enabling companies to release updates fast and often, but can't deliver the full benefits of an end-to-end DevOps approach.   
To realise the jewel in the DevOps crown - __continuous improvement__ - strategies must continue beyond the delivery pipeline, into operations, and close the feedback loop.
 
Vamp is a middleware solution that enables smart deployments and production-side monitoring of containerised (micro)services.
