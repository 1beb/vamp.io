### Vamp and your company
* Why use Vamp?   
_Our company already has a DevOps team to manage releases and deploy updates using CI/CD._  
Sounds like you’ve got things running pretty smoothly getting releases ready for users, but you could be missing an important part of the picture.   Who is looking out for your users and how are you safeguarding business goals after deployment?   Your product lives in a dynamic, ever changing state of continuous integration and rapid deployment, which is great when things run to plan, but what happens when they don’t?  
A delivery pipeline alone won't help you with operations issues. A chain of CI and CD tools channel new code through the required “cleaning filters” to test viability and integration before gracefully launching a completed product into the sea that is your live production environment. At this point, the operations team must step in to keep things afloat - development (and DevOps) have already moved on to the next release. The only way continuous delivery can save you now is by developing and releasing a patch - perhaps it will all work this time.

Chances are the release process at your company would benefit from Vamp.
