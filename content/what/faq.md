### Vamp and your company
* __Why use Vamp?__   
how do you safeguard business goals after deployment?   

Vamp challenges you to rethink how you develop and release microservice based applications.   
The life of a release doesn't end when it hits production - that's just the beginning.

* __What is canary testing/releasing?__
* __Will Vamp really make that much difference to my company?__  
If you build stateless, microservice-based web applications, chances are the release process at your company would benefit from Vamp.   


_Our company already has a DevOps team and we deploy updates using CI/CD._  
Sounds like you’ve got things running pretty smoothly to get releases ready for users, but you might be missing an important part of the puzzle. Your product lives in a dynamic, ever changing state of continuous integration and rapid deployment, which is great when things run to plan, but what happens when they don’t?
