## Vamp 0.9.0 Beta release 
_
The Vamp 0.9.0 release is a very important milestone in the lifecycle of Vamp, as we're removing the Alpha label and are moving to Beta! This means that we will do our utmost best to avoid breaking changes in our API's and DSL, focus even more on stabilising and optimising the current feature-set, while of course continuously introducing powerful new features.

The Vamp 0.9.0 release is the culmination of three months of hard work by our amazing team! This release incorporates nothing less than 115 issues and I'm very proud of what we've achieved.
