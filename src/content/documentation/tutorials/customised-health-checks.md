Vamp tracks the health of running services and gateways. Responses to outages, slowdowns and increased traffic can be automated as they occur. 

Let's get started!

### Requirements

* A running version of Vamp 0.9.4 or later (this tutorial has been tested on [Vamp v0.9.4 hello world](documentation/installation/v0.9.4/hello-world))

## Some background on default health
The default health status is calculated by the Vamp Health workflow.
