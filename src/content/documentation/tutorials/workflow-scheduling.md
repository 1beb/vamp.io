Let's get started!

### Requirements

* A running version of Vamp 0.9.x (this tutorial has been tested on [Vamp v0.9.4 hello world](documentation/installation/v0.9.4/hello-world))

## Some background on workflows and their schedules


## Trigger workflow by event



## Set time for a workflow to run


## Summing up


## Looking for more of a challenge?
Just for fun, you could try these:  

* Can you adjust the process to include a manual step?  
  (for example, require manual decommisioning of expired services)
* How would you include an automated rollback in case of errors during canary release?  
  (see the Vamp runner tutorial [automate a canary release with rollback](/documentation/tutorials/automate-a-canary-release/))
